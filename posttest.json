      "question": "As the number of components in a solution increases, the individual vapour pressure .............?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Decreases",
        "b": "Decreases and then increases",
        "c": "No effect",
        "d": "Increases"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "According to Raoult's law, adding more solute components lowers the vapour pressure.",
        "b": "Incorrect pattern for typical solutions.",
        "c": "There is an effect; this is incorrect.",
        "d": "Vapour pressure decreases, not increases."

      "question": "For non-electrolytes, the value of \"i\" is .........?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "One",
        "b": "Depending upon the ions formed",
        "c": "Two",
        "d": "Zero"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Non-electrolytes do not dissociate, so van 't Hoff factor i = 1.",
        "b": "This applies for electrolytes, not non-electrolytes.",
        "c": "Incorrect for non-electrolytes.",
        "d": "i cannot be zero; at least one particle exists."

      "answers": {
        "a": "Properties of solute",

        "c": "Temperature of the system",
        "d": "None of these"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect — it depends on the solvent, not solute.",
        "b": "Correct — the ebullioscopic constant is a property of the solvent.",
        "c": "Temperature influences boiling but constant is intrinsic to solvent.",
        "d": "Incorrect."
