      "question": "Which solution has the highest boiling point?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "2.0 m Ca(NO₃)₂",
        "b": "1.0 m Ca(NO₃)₂",
        "c": "1.0 m KNO₃",
        "d": "2.0 m KNO₃"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Higher molality and higher van 't Hoff factor (i = 3) for Ca(NO₃)₂ leads to the highest boiling point elevation.",
        "b": "Lower molality than option a, so lower boiling point elevation.",
        "c": "Lower van 't Hoff factor (i = 2) and molality compared to a and d.",
        "d": "Higher molality but lower van 't Hoff factor (i = 2) compared to option a."

      "question": "Which one of the following solvents has the lowest boiling point?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Carbon disulfide",

        "a": "Carbon disulfide has the lowest boiling point among these solvents.",
        "b": "Carbon tetrachloride boils higher than carbon disulfide.",

      "question": "As the number of components in a solution increases, the individual vapour pressure .............?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Decreases",
        "b": "Decreases and then increases",
        "c": "No effect",
        "d": "Increases"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "According to Raoult's law, adding more solute components lowers the vapour pressure.",
        "b": "Incorrect pattern for typical solutions.",
        "c": "There is an effect; this is incorrect.",
        "d": "Vapour pressure decreases, not increases."

        "c": "Two",
        "d": "Zero"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Non-electrolytes do not dissociate, so van 't Hoff factor i = 1.",
        "b": "This applies for electrolytes, not non-electrolytes.",
        "c": "Incorrect for non-electrolytes.",
        "d": "i cannot be zero; at least one particle exists."

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect — it depends on the solvent, not solute.",
        "b": "Correct — the ebullioscopic constant is a property of the solvent.",
        "c": "Temperature influences boiling but constant is intrinsic to solvent.",
        "d": "Incorrect."
