## Theory 
### Ebullioscopy:
 
#### Elevation of Boiling Point:
 
The boiling point of a liquid is the temperature at which its vapour pressure becomes equal to the external atmospheric pressure. The phenomenon that the boiling point of a solvent will be higher when another compound is added is known as Boiling point elevation, ie., the boiling point of a pure solvent will always less than its solution. The boiling point of a substance can be measured by using ebullioscopy. The addition of a non-volatile solute to pure solvent increases the boiling point of the solution. The difference between the boiling points of the solution, $T'_b$ and the pure solvent, $T_b$ is called elevation of boiling point of the solvent. 

$$\Delta T_b=T'_b - T_b$$
