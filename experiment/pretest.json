        "a": "2.0 m Ca(NO₃)₂",

        "d": "2.0 m KNO₃"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Higher molality and higher van 't Hoff factor (i = 3) for Ca(NO₃)₂ leads to the highest boiling point elevation.",
        "b": "Lower molality than option a, so lower boiling point elevation.",
        "c": "Lower van 't Hoff factor (i = 2) and molality compared to a and d.",
        "d": "Higher molality but lower van 't Hoff factor (i = 2) compared to option a."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Carbon disulfide has the lowest boiling point among these solvents.",
        "b": "Carbon tetrachloride boils higher than carbon disulfide.",
